A project to use react inside a Electron Application

There are two projecs. First one is the Electron app, which has its settings in package.json in the root.

The second project is payroll (example) that I setup manually.  You should switch to /payroll and run npm run build to get a build, the main.js is pointing to the build/index.html file.
You have to remove "/" in the build index.html file.  not sure why yet.
